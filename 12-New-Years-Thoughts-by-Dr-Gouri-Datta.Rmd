# New Year's Thoughts by Dr Gouri Datta

This is the way the landed poet thinks

Of the past and new year in metaphors –

The old man in torn fatigues hobbles past

Some keloid scars, some badges pinned, 

Gratitude for bullets dodged

Scattering casings of memories for the pickup truck

A picture becoming a shadow

A warrior becoming the steam

Of tearoom chats.

The New Year is a child at the gatepost,

The New Year is a wide-eyed earth-cub child

My poem takes a deep breath watching, heart fast

Of what is to come as saps rise.

We watch him with a patron’s kindness, and hope

He will find daisies in the fields, 

For him the taps that played the old man’s walk 

Will be the light foot polka of sunrise .
