<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 24</span> Friendship, A Tale of Two Immigrants by Nilanjana Rakhit</h1>
<p>“That’s a beautiful soro!”
Aparna turned her head slightly to the left and saw a tall woman with long auburn hair and a big smile.
“It’s saree, not soro!”
“I see, it’s a saree!”
“Hi, I am Gabrielle, Gabrielle Marie Long”.
“Hi, I am Aparna”.
“Upperna!” said Gabrielle.
Aparna was waiting for the bus at Bishop’s Corner in West Hartford, Connecticut. It was the summer of 1972; six months after Aparna came to New York City from Calcutta, after a long wait of two and a half years, to join her husband whom she had known for only two months before he left India for the U.S. on a visitor’s visa for his internship, to find out that he had fallen for another woman.
The bus to downtown made a gentle halt. Aparna embarked onto the bus and sat on the left seat and saw the woman who introduced herself as Gabrielle following her onto the bus and taking the seat right across from her. The bus started moving and picking up the speed. Gabrielle took out a bunch of greetings cards from her pocket book and tried to initiate a conversation with Aparna.
“Look how pretty these cards are. These are made with water colors. Have you heard of Monet, the French impressionist painter?”
“Indeed, they are painted with such beautiful colors! No, I haven’t heard of Monet.”
Gabrielle got busy writing on the cards. Aparna wondered who she was writing the cards to! The bus moved at its regular speed through Farmington Avenue in West Hartford. Aparna looked out through the window to see the familiar street signs and the houses including the famous Mark Twain house go pass by. Soon the bus stopped at the corner of Farmington Avenue and Sigourney Street near the old church on one side and the big brick corporate house of Aetna on the other side of the street. Aparna was to cross the street and walk down Sigourney Street to walk to their apartment on Asylum Street.
Aparna got ready to get off the bus. Surprisingly, she saw Gabrielle also getting ready to get off at the same bus stop! Just as the bus stopped and they got down, Gabrielle asked, “would you like to join me for a cup of coffee?
Aparna was a bit surprised at Gabrielle’s friendliness, but accepted her offer and said,”yes, of course, that would be nice“. Aparna was in no rush to reach home. There was no one waiting for her.
They walked up the street. There was a Greek diner nearby. This was the first time Aparna had entered a place like this. It was a typical diner of the ’70’s-serving coffee, greasy ham, bacon, toasts and eggs. This being a Greek diner, it also offered stuffed green pepper with ground lamb and other Greek specialties and coin-up juke boxes for entertainment.
They ordered coffee. Gabrielle initiated the conversation and asked Aparna,”where do you live?&quot;
“Asylum Avenue”, said Aparna.
“Oh, we also live close by, off Sigourney Street, right behind Aetna.”
“I live with my parents and seven brothers. They are all younger to me”.
“No wonder, we got off at the same bus stop”, Aparna thought.
Gabrielle asked Aparna what took her to Bishops Corner. Aparna told her that she wanted to learn typing. They had a Remington typewriter in their house from her father’s textile marketing business he ran for few years, but never bothered to learn it seriously.<br />
Aparna paused for a minute and saw Gabrielle listening to her curiously.
“Please continue”, said Gabrielle.
“Let’s save it for another day. May I ask you what brought you to Bishop’s Corner”?
“Oh yes, I teach French to a lady who lives around there”.
“Would you like to join me for lunch Saturday”, asked Aparna.
“Oh, that sounds good. I will see you Saturday”.
Aparna was desperately looking for a job. It had been only a few months since she moved to a new country with a completely different culture than the one she left behind. It was a restless time in America. Vietnam war had not yet ended, there were demonstrations at colleges and universities. People were experimenting on unprecedented life style like living together and having babies out-of-wedlock. To Aparna television was the mirror of the American society. Never realized there were many other human tales that never reached the media or the television screens. Aparna pondered, “is there any family life in America, like the one I left behind?”
Life seemed meaningless as if she had been robbed off a few precious years of her youth and the opportunity of her life time of completing her master’s degree at Calcutta University; as if the roof of her sheltered life had been blown away by a tornado rendering her shelter-less with no ways to turning back. She had no options but to look forward to an unknown future.<br />
*********
Aparna often ruminated over why and how did it all go so wrong! She was only 19 and was getting ready for her B.A. Honors final exams when an aunt’s neighbor came with a marriage proposal to her parents for a groom who completed his internship having graduated from the R. G. Kar Medical College in Calcutta. Her parents were told that the prospect will be going to America for higher studies and after completing his training will be returning home to open a nursing home to practice medicine.
A date was fixed for the groom and his family to see Aparna and meet her family. Aparna was just too busy with her forthcoming final exams in a month. She immersed herself in the studies of Chaucer, the chapters from his Canterbury Tales, being introduced to his iambic pentameters. The studies of linguistics and the derivatives of many English words from German, French or Latin; of metaphysical poets like John Dunn; comparisons of Shelley’s Skylark “the blithe spirit” and Wordsworth’s Skylark; Wordsworth’s visits and re-visits to the river Yarrow that were parts of her syllabus consumed much of her precious time. The narrative of Coleridge’s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner lamenting the Albatross hanging about his neck and its interpretation occupied many hours. Robert Browning’s dramatic monologue in Porphyria’s Lover consumed her focus. Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s sonnet “How do I love thee? Let me count the ways” touched her tender young heart as she studied it and her other sonnets and learned about this future Mrs. Robert Browning. She was bemused by George Bernard Shaw’s Arms and the Man; saddened by J.M. Synge’s Riders to the Sea; enchanted by the ghost and the witches and the famous soliloquies in her studies of Shakespeare’s tragedies. That was Aparna’s world!
Reluctantly, Aparna took some time off her studies and met the groom and his family. She did not want anyone to interfere with her studies until her exams were over. But the groom and his family had a different plan unbeknownst to Aparna. While Aparna’s elders struggled to agree to marry her into a caste lower than theirs, the groom’s family would frequent Aparna’s house anytime and was insisting on having her parents agree to this marriage, even telling them anecdotes like the groom and the family had received hundred proposals from the families of prospective brides! The groom’s sister and mother told Aparna’s parents that the groom wanted to marry Aparna, or else he would not marry before going to America. The groom’s family must knew him well and was in a rush to marry him lest he fell in love with an American girl and forgot his family.<br />
After much soul searching and discussions about the differences in cast, added by persistent eagerness shown by the groom and his family Aparna’s parents and relatives agreed to the marriage. He was eligible, they thought. He was educated, an athlete, handsome, and was endowed with a melodious voice and above all eager to marry Aparna. But he was vain, as Aparna would later realize. Aparna’s father was reluctant to have her married so young. He always had faith in Aparna and wanted her to pursue higher studies. In accordance with Indian calendar a date was set for the wedding to take place just one week before Aparna’s final exams!
Before she could fathom what was going on, Aparna was married away. The day after the wedding reception at the groom’s house, Aparna returned to her parents to prepare and take her final B. A. exams. Two weeks later after the exams, Aparna’s new husband visited her parents to take Aparna to their house. Within two months he left for America on visitor’s visa for his internship leaving Aparna to live with her in-laws. Aparna was stuck in Calcutta living with her in-laws for two and a half years waiting for the approval of her husband’s permanent resident status. The promise of her husband’s returning to Calcutta to practice medicine never materialized.</p>
<pre><code>                    *******
                </code></pre>
<p>Aparna was happy to meet Gabrielle and was looking forward to the lunch on Saturday. Trying to impress her new American friend, Aparna prepared Campbell’s tomato soup with peas and hot dog with mustard and tomato sauce! Later on, Gabrielle teased Aparna over the lunch menu and they had good laughs! Gabrielle expected an Indian lunch.
As they were having lunch, their conversation turned serious. Gabrielle asked, “can we pick up with your story, Aparna.”
“Are you sure you want to hear my story”, asked Aparna.
“Yes, of course.”
Aparna continued. “I had an undergraduate honors degree in English literature and Political Science and was admitted into the Calcutta University for the Master’s degree program, but was not allowed to attend the classes because Calcutta University was a co-educational institution. I was living with my in-laws then”.
“You lived with your in-laws while your husband was away”?
“Yes, I did”.
“They did not approve of my taking the public transportation, yet only wealthy people owned automobiles back then. My in-laws had a black Morris. It was either driven by my father-in-law or his driver to take him to places. My in-laws were living in South Calcutta and the University was located in North Calcutta. Public transportation was the only means of conveyance back then”.
Aparna pondered the daily life of a commuter in the city. It was long before the Calcutta Metro was built. It was the time when the streets of Calcutta were all dug up for the building of the underground metro! It was a miserable time for the commuters. But the residents of the city are known for their resilience! It did not bother Aparna to take public transportation. She was more excited about her admission into the Master’s program at Calcutta University.
“Aparna, would you like to hear my story,” said Gabrielle.
“I would be delighted to. Tell me about your life”.
Gabrielle told Aparna about her fiancé Bill, how she met him at a bar. At 17, she was in a car accident and while in the hospital the doctors diagnosed her with Hodgkin’s disease. She had gone through radiation therapy that destroyed her reproductive system. Gabrielle told Aparna, how in spite of knowing all of Gabrielle’s physical ailments, Bill stuck to her, and did not end their relationship.<br />
Gabrielle was also fairly new in America. Her parents emigrated to America from New Brunswick, Canada and settled in Hartford, Connecticut only a few years ago after Gabrielle completed her undergraduate studies in Philosophy. She was fluent in French (she would say in Parisian French!) and spoke American English with a faint accent! In the French tradition, she was very friendly and could very easily start a conversation even with a stranger, whether a man or a woman, a child or an adult. Such was her passion for life! As if she had only that day to live, only that person to meet!
Gabrielle was teaching school when Aparna met her. An extremely resourceful school teacher who was well-read in world literature and philosophy and was very well liked by her young students. Gabrielle had tons of books in their house, every one of them she had read, some more than once. One day she brought Radha Krishnan’s Eastern Religions &amp; Western Thought and another day Rabindranath Tagore’s Geetanjali, and yet another day Ved Mehta’s Portrait of India for Aparna to read. Gabrielle introduced Aparna to the writings of French philosopher Camus, German philosophers Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche.</p>
<p>Aarana was familiar with the English, American and French literature for she had studied western literature in her undergraduate studies. Also through her mother who was an avid reader of foreign literature, and enjoyed watching foreign movies and she would discuss with her children how she enjoyed them, but not much with the Western philosophers.</p>
<p>Gabrielle wanted to learn Bengali and could say, “aami tomader shonge tomader bhashay kotha bolte chai (I want to speak with you in your language)”. Sometimes she would say this to Aparna’s Bengali friends. Surprised, they would eagerly wait to hear more from her. She would give a big smile and continue in English. She was such an enlightened soul and enriched herself with the wealth of knowledge!
A few weeks later, Gabrielle called and said, “Apadna”, I am getting married on October 13, and I would like you to meet my fiancé Billy.&quot;
“Congratulations! I would be delighted to meet your fiancé.”
Gabrielle invited Aparna to her parent’s home to meet her fiancé. Gabrielle’s mother was of French decent and her father Mr. Long’s family came from Scotland settling in New Brunswick, Canada. It had been only a few years since the Long family moved to America settling in Hartford, Connecticut.
Bill was sitting in the living room when Aparna entered.
“I am Bill, Bill Brezinski.”
“I am Aparna, nice meeting you, Bill”.
“Same here, Aparna. I heard a lot about you from Gabe”.
Aparna was delighted with the way Gabrielle’s family including Bill welcomed her in their home. In all these months, since she came to America, for the first time Aparna felt assured that there was normal family life in America as well, just like the one she left behind in India.
Bill Brezinsky was truly a gentleman. Bill’s family was Polish-American. His grandfather came from Poland. They were middle class Americans with good family values. Bill was tall and handsome with blue eyes and slightly curly auburn hair and a beard. His father worked at the U.S. Post Office and so did he. Bill was a very mature and down to earth person. Like most American men, Bill liked to drink Budweiser and watch baseball and football. He also played baseball. Gabe and Bill were different in their attitude towards life and their differences attracted them towards each other and they became very good friends.<br />
Gabrielle became busy preparing for her upcoming wedding. They were to be wedded at the old church in the corner of Sigourney St. and Farmington Avenue where Gabrielle and Aparna got off from the bus when they first met. Gabrielle wanted Aparna to be her maid of honor. So they went to G. Fox to try bride’s maids dresses. Gabrielle chose brownish red. She chose a long gown with full sleeves and short neckline with multi-color embroideries of flowers and leaves around the neckline and the sleeves to go with a fall wedding in October. It was an expensive dress for Aparna just to wear it for one day, yet she did not mind. It became even more expensive when Aparna would not be able to attend the wedding ceremony and another friend of Gabrielle would wear the dress for the wedding. Suddenly, Aparna had to leave for India a few weeks before the wedding as her parents and in-laws came to know about her predicament and her family life in America was becoming increasingly unbearable.
**********
When Aparna returned from India, Gabrielle and Bill were already married and settled in an apartment in a two storied building south of the city of Hartford. Across from their apartment was a long stretch of reservation land with tall maple trees that looked barren in deep winter, then blossomed with green maple leaves for the spring and summer only to turn into vibrant colors of red, brown and yellow ushering the fall and then be naked again standing straight and tall.
Gabrielle invited Aparna to see her new life with Bill and a new dog Hennessey, a golden retriever.
Hennessey was a character! One day Aparna was sitting in Gabrielle’s living room with her legs folded on the sofa reading, when suddenly she noticed that one of her brand new canvas summer shoes had been chewed by Hennessey and small pieces were lying on the wooden floor. Aparna jumped up and cried,</p>
<p>“Gabrielle, look what Hennessey has done to my shoes”!</p>
<p>Gabrielle was in the kitchen preparing vichyssoise, a French soup she used to make with pureed leaks, potatoes, cream and chicken broth. She would make a huge bowl of vichyssoise and serve it cold. It was out of the world! Gabrielle, screamed, “Billy, get Hennessey out”. Billy was watching his favorite game in the other room. Both of them rushed to the living room, put Hennessey on the leash and dragged him to the porch. For a while Hennessey was nowhere to be found. Later that day, after we had lunch with vichyssoise, homemade garlic bread and wine, Gabrielle went to her bedroom and called Aparna there to see what Hennessey was up to. He was sitting near the bed with his head down and occasionally giving a mischievous glance at them! It was hilarious!</p>
<p>After returning from India, Aparna found a job with an insurance company, walked out of her lousy marriage with a single set of clothing and moved to a studio apartment near Mark Twain house.
Aparna bought her first car and felt free for the first time. It was a year old Volkswagen Super Beetle, Aparna bought for $1,900 from an Indian family that was returning to India. She put $900 down payment and went to the bank for a loan of $1,000. A Bengali friend advised Aparna to take a loan from the bank so that she could establish a credit history. It was her first experience with borrowing money and learning to be financially responsible for paying off debt.</p>
<p>In course of time Aparna, Gabrielle and Bill became good friends. With her new life, new place to live and a new car, Aparna would frequently visit Gabrielle and Bill. For some reasons, Bill trusted Aparna a whole lot. He would fix Rusty Nails for Gabrielle and introduce Aparna to various American hard drinks. Aparna never developed any likings for any of these drinks. She liked wine. Being French, Gabrielle was a connoisseur of wine and cheese. She introduced Aparna to cognac, after dinner drinks like Cream de Mint, Cream de Violet. It was a completely new world for Aparna! In their household, her father never drank lest the children be influenced by it, never even played cards although her grandmother was fond of playing cards and would often play bridge with her nephews and nieces.
Gabrielle and Bill’s doors were always open for Aparna. She would visit them whenever she had free time, especially on weekends she and Gabrielle walking Hennessey and strolling down the long stretch of wooded area they had across the street. Bill would be busy preparing barbeque steak or pork chops for himself and Gabrielle and chicken for Aparna.<br />
Aparna imagined that the more people look around them and are mindful of what they see the more their outlook broadens. They see connections among people, among places, among cultures.
In the Brezinski’s and the Long’s, Aparna saw and experienced events that never reached the media or the television, the real stories of real people, their sorrows and happiness, their strengths and frailties.
The endearing relationship the three developed over time reminded Aparna of the days whenever Prabhamashi (aunt Prabha) came to visit them. Aparna’s father would buy tickets for Prabhamashi and her mother to see their favorite plays at the theatres in Calcutta. Prabha Dasgupta was a pretty and a learned woman with discriminating taste. She treated Aparna and her siblings as her own children. Prabha Dasgupta was her mother’s friend from college days. It was during those days that Aparna’s parents met and fell in love. Her father Nikhil was tall and handsome, an idealist freedom fighter who was spared his life as a juvenile with the pleading of Mahatma Gandhi and served as a political prisoner earning him a Copper Plaque from Indira Gandhi for his valor. Her mother Lata was an ardent lover of world literature and imbued herself in Rabindra Sangeet with her melodious voice. Prabha was also in love with someone but her parents did not allow her to marry him. Prabha never married and joined government services as an officer while Aparna’s mother went into teaching schools.<br />
**********
Soon came the Christmas time. That was Gabrielle and Bill’s first Christmas as a married couple. They invited Aparna as their guest to the family Christmas party. All members from Bill’s side of the family gathered at his aunt’s house in Wethersfield. That was Aparna’s first Christmas with an American family. She had attended Christmas parties at the Bengali households in America. But this was a different experience.
They were Polish-Americans. So, the menu included ham baked in glazed pineapple juice, with cloves, mashed potatoes, baby corn, string beans, salad, garlic bread, and pierogi, cabbage filled savory dumplings boiled and pan fried. No Polish holiday party is complete without serving pierogi! There was a separate tableful of deserts: lemon meringue, essentially a lemon pie topped with a fluffy mixture of egg white and sugar tinted with a light brown texture on top from baking; apple pie, pecan pie, blue berry pie, chocolate cake and ice-cream.
The whole family welcomed Aparna as one of them and showered her with gifts as they did to each other. Bill’s mother Mrs. Brezinski handed three boxes, one to her daughter Nancy, one to Gabrielle and one to Aparna, whom she used to call her third daughter! Mrs. Brezinski would say, “I have three daughters, Nancy, Gabrielle and you, Aparna”. They contained three beautiful night gowns-blue, pink and yellow. Mrs. Brezinski had her three daughters hold up the night gowns so that Mr. Brezinski could take their pictures in his Polaroid! Mrs. Brezinski also gave each of her three daughters a woolen scarf, a cap, and a pair of mittens so lovingly and carefully hand knitted by herself. Aparna was overwhelmed by the goodness and love this American family could shower her with! The scene from The Sound of Music flashed in her mind where Reverend Mother was telling Maria, “when God closes the door, somewhere he opens the windows”.
Gabrielle’s family was different from the Brezinski’s. Aparna had the impression that all western families might have similar cultures. Having seen the two western families so closely she realized that that was not always the case. Gabrielle’s parents had a good marriage, unlike the ones Aparna was so used to seeing on television. Mrs. Long was a dignified woman always maintaining her distinction as a French -Canadian lady. Mr. Long and Gabrielle’s seven younger brothers were just the opposite. They were more Americanized, fun loving but always together and united as a family. One of the brothers Danny was married to very sweet French-Canadian girl named Michelle. They welcomed Aparna as another older sister like Gabrielle.
The Long’s enjoyed going out to dance with their friends, the Nadeau’s. They were also French Canadians. They lived and owned a profitable swimming pool business outside the city of Hartford. The Nadeau’s invited Aparna to visit them. There were two swimming pools near their house and a farmhouse in the back where they feasted on barbeque chicken and smoked marsh mellows. The more of these wholesome middle-class families that Aparna was meeting the more she became assured of normal family life in America just like the ones Aparna was so familiar with and was missing so much!
Some ten years later Gabrielle would call Aparna to inform her that the Nadeau’s older daughter Dianna killed herself with a gun shot inside the same farm house where her father kept his rifle. Dianna was studying at the Boston University where she met an Indian boy and fell deeply in love with him. They dated through their college years and beyond. Then the boy went to visit his family in India and came back with his new wife of his parent’s choice. Dianna was devastated! She succumbed to deep depression. The Nadeau’s tried hard spending a lot of money to bring Dianna to normalcy. But it was all in vain! One morning they were startled with gun shots coming from the farm house. Their darkest nightmare came true. Rushing to the farm house they found Dianna lying on the floor bleeding from the gun shot. The Nadeaue’s had heard and seen enough of Indian men! Aparna never saw the Nadeau’s again.
*****
With a promotion at work, Aparna could afford a better place to live. So when her Bengali friends moved from their nearby apartment to a new house in Bloomfield, Aparna followed them and rented a one bedroom apartment in an apartment complex with tennis courts and a swimming pool. It was further away from where Gabrielle and Bill lived. But their friendship continued and got deeper. Occasionally the threesome will meet for a game of tennis at Aparna’s apartment complex.
One Saturday Bill was busy with his work and Gabrielle visited Aparna for a game of tennis and swimming. After the game they went to the only pub in their town. It was an upscale pub. Live music was playing and a woman singing the ’70s popular songs. Gabrielle went to the restroom while Aparna sat at a table. No sooner than they took the seat than a bartender came to Aparna and whispered,
“We do not allow tennis attire here.”
Aparna turned red and said, &quot; I am just waiting for my friend.&quot;
Soon Gabrielle returned. Aparna said to her, “we need to get out from here right away. I will tell you later why.”
They hopped in Aparna’s car. On the way back to Aparna’s apartment, Gabrielle said,
“I have got an idea, Aparna. Why don’t I wear one of your sarees and go back to the pub”.
“Are you serious? exclaimed Aparna”.
“Yes, I am”.
Indeed, Gabrielle chose an ink blue Benarasi with gold border and motifs to wear and laid her long auburn hair down. The two returned to the pub and asked to see the manager. The manager was sitting in the back room. Gabrielle walked straight into the manager’s room. Like a model, bowed down, and stretching her left arm and displaying the saree took a round like a dancer and bowed down again in front of the manager and with a big smile said,
“Is this proper, now?”
The pub manager was taken aback! Smiling and nodding his head he said, “yes”.
Aparna and Gabrielle returned to where the music was still playing and the singer was singing and sat at one of the round tables, called the waiter and ordered a Rusty Nail for Gabrielle and a wine for Aparna. Within a few minutes, the waiter returned with two Rusty Nails and two glasses of wine. Perplexed, Gabrielle said,
“We did not order that many drinks”!
Smiling, the waiter said, “our manager ordered them for you and they are on the house”.
Such was Gabrielle’s love of people and life, a truly engagingly endearing person Aparna had ever met!
Whenever they came to visit Aparna, Gabrielle would always look into the refrigerator to see whether there were any leftovers. She liked Indian food so much, especially the vegetarian dishes. Bill, on the contrary was a quintessential steak and mashed potato man. Aparna could never get him to like Indian food, except once for an Indian style pork chops dinner. Such was their love and hate relationship with Indian food!
*****
Soon Aparna’s divorce was finalized and she never looked back. Just before he completed his residency and about to begin his medical practice at an upscale neighborhood, Aparna’s estranged husband very conveniently filed for a divorce. Aparna’s idealist father who fought to free his own country from the bondage of the British Raj , and reluctantly agreed to the marriage, could do nothing for the humiliation Aparna’s husband had caused his daughter being so far away and met with an early death.</p>
<p>Aparna came to the realization that in order to be self-sufficient she needed an American degree. But where would the money come from? She talked to her boss and found out that her employer had a 100% education reimbursement program provided it was work-related. Aparna made an appointment and met with the Dean of the Business School at the University of Hartford. The Dean was impressed and admitted her into the MBA program; ordered her to take a certain number of pre-requisites as she did not have these subjects in her undergraduate studies. Within a couple of years Aparna earned her MBA.
*****
One day Gabrielle called Aparna and said, “Aparna, we are buying a house. It’s a two family house”.
“I am very happy to hear the news”.
“Billy’s father is making the down payment and Billy will take the mortgage on the house”.
“That sounds great!”
“Billy’s father cannot get a mortgage, because he will be retiring in a few years. That’s why he will make the down payment and Billy will carry the mortgage”.
Soon they moved to their new house. It was a two storied building. The senior Brezinski’s occupying the first floor and Billy and Gabrielle living on the second floor. No sooner than the Brezinki’s moved to their new home, than problems began to surface. Personality clashes between Gabrielle and Mrs. Brezinki ensued.
Gabrielle was not very happy about the arrangement. Mrs. Brezinski would come upstairs often to check on what her son had for lunch or dinner which Gabrielle thought was intrusive. It bothered her. She would often complain to Aparna.
“You are being too critical about Mrs. Brezinski, Gabrielle. They are just simple, traditional and honest people”, Aparna would say, thinking how common it is in Indian culture for a mother-in-law to live under the same roof with her son and daughter-in-law. At least Bill’s parents had separate living quarters, even though they lived in the same building.<br />
Gabrielle was also becoming increasingly impatient with Bill’s bear drinking and being glued to television watching baseball games. She would want him to go to movies or concerts or even read a book together. But Bill would not change.<br />
Gabrielle decided to go for her Masters degree in Philosophy at Boston University on a scholarship and soon moved to Boston.<br />
One day, Aparna received a phone call from Bill. He was crying over the phone. Aparna was stunned. Bill was torn between his mother and his wife.
“Aparna, Gabrielle moved to Boston to do her Masters in Philosophy at Boston University. My mother is not liking it”.
Aparna sensed something was not right and was awfully sorry for Bill. His parents all their lives lived in an apartment. Sending two children to college they exhausted all their earnings. Only at retirement that they had enough savings for the down payment for a place which they could call their own but no regular income to be eligible for a loan. Bill provided that support by assuming the mortgage for the purchase of a two storied building each occupying a floor.<br />
Two years went by. Gabrielle would come home on weekends and be busy in Boston the rest of the week with her studies. Bill and his parents grew closer and his relationship to Gabrielle gradually reached the brink of separation. After graduation, Gabrielle returned home and resumed teaching. By then they became strangers to each other and within a short time they divorced. Gabrielle moved back to live with her parents.
*****
Aparna lost all connections with Bill after his divorce from Gabrielle. She heard from Gabrielle that within a year or so of their divorce, Bill remarried the widow of his high school friend Jim. Jim had just met a terrible death in a motor cycle accident on Rt. 84 leaving behind his young wife Linda and two young children. With his new wife and the ready-made young family Bill rented out his apartment and moved to a house in Simsbury, an upscale town near Hartford. When Aparna heard the news she was happy for Bill and thought he would be a good father to Linda’s two young children.
Gabrielle continued with her teaching at a school. Life did not become any easier after her divorce from Bill. In a couple of years she met Peter. He was the head of information technology at a college in Hartford. Peter, in many ways, resembled Bill, soft spoken and gentle mannered. Gabrielle and Peter grew closer and eventually moved to an apartment in West Hartford. They never married. But Peter was more than a husband. In due course, Aparna would realize that even many husbands would not be so committed and do what Peter did for Gabrielle till the end and beyond.</p>
<pre><code>                *****</code></pre>
<p>One summer, Aparna’s Guruji came for a visit at her Bengali friend Trina’s house. Trina and her husband Arijit were God sent! Aparna met them before she met Gabrielle. They knew her situation and protected Aparna like her own family. It was at their house that Aparna saw Guruji for the first time.</p>
<p>Gabrielle also knew Trina. She wanted to meet Guruji and become His disciple. Aparna took her to meet her Guruji. He blessed her and prayed for her recovery and made her His disciple by giving her a secret mantra to chant. Gabrielle would take it by heart and even introduced yoga to her students and continued to have them practice yoga in school for half-hour every day. She convinced the principal about the benefits of yoga and managed her to authorize Gabrielle to practice yoga with her students in school.</p>
<p>Gabrielle’s Hodgkin’s disease was in remission all these years. Within a few years after she started living with Peter, the disease resurfaced. Her condition started deteriorating. Gabrielle was hospitalized as her internal organs began to fail. Every time Gabrielle was hospitalized, Aparna thought this would the last time she will see her friend. Aparna would cook Gabrielle’s favorite dish and take it to the hospital. Gabrielle would only take a small piece, put in her mouth, and close her eyes with a smile on her face.</p>
<p>Gabrielle was lucky to be returning home from that ordeal. Peter steadfastly nursed her, timely giving her medication and helping her walk from one room to another carrying inter-venous tubes. Gabrielle’s condition further deteriorated and she was hospitalized again. She wanted Guruji to visit her at the hospital. Guruji fulfilled her wishes and visited her at the hospital and blessed her. Gabrielle was able to return home again.
********
Soon it was Christmas time. The Long’s since moved back to New Brunswick after retirement. They wanted to spend that Christmas with Gabrielle. Aparna was also invited to the Christmas party. The apartment was nicely decorated with a large real Christmas tree, just like the ones that Gabrielle and Bill used to have in their apartment. Gabrielle had a large dining table. She decorated it with a red table cloth, lit a cluster of large white candles on a tray, and set the dining table with her Lenox china and Oneida cutlery. Then she uncorked the wine bottles and poured some red wine into the wine glasses, played Strauss and invited everyone to take their seats at the table.
Gabrielle’s father Mr. Long was so happy to see Aparna after a long time. He knelt down in front of her, took her hand and kissed it with tears trickling down his cheeks and said,
“Aparna, thank you for being a true friend to Gabi, and also to the Long family.”
Aparna was overwhelmed with Mr. Long’s gesture and pondered how the humanity is connected to each other how the same feelings permeate the whole world. Aparna found in Mr. Long her own father who wrote her a letter every ten days until his death.
After Christmas, Gabriel’s condition further deteriorated. She would continue to chant the mantras she heard from Guruji as she was becoming increasingly frail.
“All my organs are gradually failing, Aparna”, said Gabrielle gently, almost like a whisper.<br />
“Go to the bedroom and bring me the small diary on the side table.”
Aparna went to the bedroom and brought the diary and gave it to Gabrielle.
“Open it. There is a poem I wrote. Take it”.
That was her last poem.
&quot;The pain is telling me
that I am moving
through something
and that I am moving things</p>
<p>I can take it
because I am growing
And the old shell is just too small</p>
<p>I am cramped inside
feverishly preoccupied from everywhere
building a larger space
for myself</p>
<p>You will know when the
project is finished
I’ll have more space for
you too&quot;.</p>
<p>During the last few weeks of her life, Gabrielle would ask Aparna to read from Bhagavad Gita and explain its messages to her lying down on the couch with her eyes closed. Aparna sitting on a chair next to the couch would explain to her the three yoga’s preached by Bhagavad Gita - karma yoga (work is worship), gyana yoga,(the wisdom or knowledge of Brahman) and bhakti yoga (devotion and ultimate surrender to God). Gabrielle would listen passively and then say,
“Aparna, of all the three yoga’s, gyana yoga is my most favorite”.<br />
No wonder. All her life, Gabrielle pursued an un-satiable quest for knowledge by surrounding herself with the works of great philosophers. In her final days, that quest for knowledge redeemed her by reaching a higher level of understanding of Life giving her the ultimate peace of mind. That was their last time together.
Soon after that, Gabrielle was hospitalized again as all her organs began to fail one after the other and her abdomen was flooded with fluids. That was her last trip to the hospital.
At Gabrielle’s funeral, always calm and collected Peter read the eulogy:
&quot;Gabrielle had so much to offer the world where she traveled that it strikes me as a painfully unjust twist or almighty misunderstanding to remove her from this place where so few as worthy reside without question. For those here who did not really know her I assure you that Gabrielle was a very special person. She was unique in every way and I am certain that if you knew her that you would love her as her parents and brothers and friends did, and as I did, and still do, and always will’.
Looking at Gabrielle lying in the casket covered with white flowers, Aparna remembered her smiling face when she first met Gabrielle at the bus stop. Aparna laid the bouquet of flowers she brought for her dear friend.
The hearse was waiting outside. Gabrielle’s seven brothers carried the casket outside and gently laid it into the hearse. Aparna followed everyone else to the hearse. It started moving and gradually disappeared from the sight.<br />
That afternoon Aparna returned home with a heavy heart and wondered why did she have to lose her most engagingly endearing friend who defying all odds since the day she learned she had Hodgkin’s disease lived and loved life so passionately!
Aparna thought how could she ever erase the indelible marks Gabrielle, Bill and their families and friends made in enriching her, in shaping her and helping her adjust and assimilate in a new culture and a new country.
