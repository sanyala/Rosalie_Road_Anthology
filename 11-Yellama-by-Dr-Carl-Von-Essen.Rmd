# Yellama by Dr Carl Von Essen

**1. The Village**
The rising sun lit the barren peaks of the Jawadhi Hills with shades of rose and amber. Soon, its rays glistened on the brilliant green of the paddy fields as six women emerged from the small Tamil village of Elagiri. They walked carefully in single file along the earthen ridges separating the watery rectangles that stretched in a checkerboard pattern along the broad valley.
“Ayo,” one of them called, “Let us hurry to finish planting before the sun gets too hot.”
“Yellamma!” Another woman cried in her shrill voice, “You were trying to get out of working all day yesterday too! Today we must finish the whole field.

```
                                           

Yellamma said nothing. At twenty-five she was younger than the others and thus was the last in the line. The red sari was already tucked between her legs like a men’s dhoti. She was ready for the arduous task of planting seedlings of rice one by one, carefully spaced in the muddy loam that the men had furrowed the day before. 

Her eyes betrayed the weeks of constant pain and difficulty in eating enough to nourish her for such work. This was a shameful secret that had beset her small household. The mouth sore was a well-known condition among the villagers and was thought to result from evil spirits. Exorcists sometimes came to the village and sing sacred chants as they danced in front of the afflicted. Yellamma had seen them but also saw the patients usually wither away and die.

Then there was the village healer, Govindaswami, but she was afraid of what he might do, remembering the screams of the men and women who had gone for his treatment.
Appiah, her husband was fearful, too, and had tried to ignore her complaints. He was busy, anyway, in dealing with the panchayat, plowing the fields and loading the ripened and threshed paddy onto the village’s bullock cart for the overnight journey to the market town. His mother, Chinamma, lived with them, cooked and looked after the 
children.

```
                            

She was a small, bright-eyed and witty woman who loved to gossip and was even friendly with her daughter-in-law, but had a foreboding of what was happening and was going to happen. Chinamma had already started cooking softer rice with curds that Yellamma could swallow. Even the breakfast upma was too hard for her painful mouth.

The village lay in the center of the fertile valley. The simple huts with roofs of thatched Palmyra leaves were scattered around a deep well and shielded from the sun by coconut palms, peepal, papaya and mango trees. There were no doors or windows, just openings in the walls of sun burnt brick and clay. Small outhouses and cattle sheds ensured the sanitary state of the village, while the courtyards were swept clean by the women every morning. The men stayed aloof from these mundane chores. They were responsible for the germination and cultivation of the young paddy plants, the maintenance and operation of the irrigation system, plowing, transporting and selling of the threshed and winnowed paddy, and various vegetables in the market.

```                                         


The elders, all men, the panchayat governing the area, lounged most days in the village center, smoking bidis and gossiping.  

The village functioned quietly and efficiently in its daily activities but there were many social occasions when the routine was interrupted. Pongal, the harvest festival full of dance and music, came in the winter, and then came the annual pilgrimage to the Venkateshwara temple at Tirumala.  The young women had their long black tresses shorn for the glory of Vishnu and the enrichment of the bulging coffers of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams Trust, the hegemony of the temple priests and local Brahmins in the cool highlands of southern Andhra Pradesh. Dravidian hair was said to be the finest in the world and was prized globally for the making of wigs and cross-hairs for the bombsights on aircraft and on other ballistic weapons. Yellamma had already made two pilgrimages and been shorn each time. Then too there were weddings and funerals and births in the village and the periodic pujas at the small neighborhood temple. 

Yellamma, large eyed and attractive, was born in the village, married at fourteen, and had delivered three children. Her main occupation was to work with fellow villagers, planting the rice seedlings. At harvest time the women and men used small sickles to cut the plants with the ripe rice kernels. After drying for a week the paddy was threshed over a smooth floor by beating with flails. Finally the threshed paddy was winnowed by slowly shaking basketfuls of grain in a good breeze, allowing the dust and chaff to blow away as the paddy flowed into wicker baskets ready then to be filled into burlap sacks. 

Like most of the other villagers, Yellamma enjoyed chewing betel quids when working. While the men could also smoke, women had no recourse but to chew betel, often with a pinch of powdered tobacco. The habit grew with age and she often slept with the quid between the lower teeth and the left cheek. The tobacco gave a feeling of contentment and allayed hunger pangs.

Yellamma was only twenty-five when a growth in her inner cheek developed that gradually became painful. This had happened to others in the village, when the pain and discomfort became bothersome, they asked for help from the village healer.

Lean but muscular, Govindaswami was a jack-of-all-trades, a member of the Achari caste of artisans and a member of the Panchayat, building furniture, repairing implements and forging iron fittings for the bullock carts, harnesses, and the irrigation system. With his practical mind, his forge, and the support of the Brahmin priest in the nearby temple he became the village healer.  Villagers came to him for simple remedies such as hot oil massage for arthritic aches, ayurvedic remedies for diarrhea and constipation. But when a man or woman came to see him with the aching sore in the cheek he prescribed and gave a treatment with a hot poker applied to the face until the heat was unbearable.  As the growth became worse, as they all seemed to do, he gave even more drastic treatments until the growth had erupted through the skin. Then he heated the poker in the forge to red-hot heat and seared the growth to the sound of screams that resounded throughout the village.

Over the months, Yellamma’s symptoms became worse and she lost more weight from the pain of eating. Chinamma became worried and talked to her son. “Your wife is having the same problem as the others. You must do something, Appiah!”  He nodded, reluctantly, knowing that there was trouble ahead.
Appiah confronted Yellamma during their evening meal. “Wife, you must have this looked after. Why not ask Govindaswami? He can help you,” he asked gently. 

“I don’t want to go to Govindaswami,” she replied firmly.  “His patients suffer and then die. Take me in your next trip to the town where I can go to the big mission hospital.” Chinamma agreed. She had been to the hospital years before when she had her cataracts removed. “My eyesight became suddenly better although I must wear heavy glasses now” she said. “They will know what to do.”
“But it will cost money, Yellamma, and those foreigners will try to make you a Christian!” replied Appiah.

“I don’t care. You see I am doing no good now and it will get worse.” 
Chinamma said, “I will go with you. The children can stay with my sister. Appiah will have to take care of himself. We can go with him on the bullock cart tomorrow night.”
Appiah finally agreed and they prepared for the long journey to the town.

**2. The Hospital**
They left the village at midnight, soon reaching the paved highway to the market town. Two bullocks pulled the wooden cart piled high with sacks of paddy. Underneath was a single flickering kerosene lantern swinging under the single axle, barely visible to the occasional lorries speeding past. Yellamma and Chinamma found a snug place to sleep while Appiah dozed on top of the piled sacks, occasionally urging the bullocks on with a flick of the quirt.

When dawn lighted the sky the cart had reached the outskirts of the town and as traffic increased, all headed toward the market square where produce from the surrounding countryside was bartered and sold. They passed the large, sprawling red sandstone Mogul fort, an outpost of Tipu Sultan, surrounded by a moat, now 160 years later half filled only with hyacinths and some green, slimy water.

A large walled compound appeared; a sign in English and Tamil identified it as the mission hospital. Numerous white multistoried buildings were still lit with electric lights. Appiah gently woke the two women, gave money and arranged a meeting place in the evening when they might return to Elagiri.

Chinamma took Yellamma by the hand into the compound. It was all frightening; numerous figures were hurrying in different directions in the early daylight. A group of nurses, in snow-white saris went by. Chinamma asked them for directions. One nurse guided the two women to the outpatient registration. The surrounding buildings seemed huge, many even with elevators. Strange languages were heard as they went through the registration procedures and finally reached the clinic. But there was no rushing or crowding as so often happened in train stations or markets. Each patient was given a chit with a number, to be called in turn. 

Eventually Yellamma was ushered into a cubicle with an examination chair. A young white coated woman, speaking her tongue, interviewed and examined her. After a while a group of older doctors came in and repeated the process.  Several seemed to come from other parts of India and there were even two white doctors, one a white haired lady who spoke Tamil in an American accent. Yellamma knew that from seeing American movies in the local cinema. After they examined her they went on to examine the patients in the adjoining cubicles. Eventually the young doctor returned, called back Chinamma, and sat down with both of them.

“Yellamma,” she said, “you have a growth that we can treat and possibly cure if you follow our instructions absolutely and complete the treatment schedule.” The young woman then gave a detailed plan. Yellamma somehow knew that this reality had come but at the same time was deeply frightened. She turned to Chinamma, who could only nod her head, tears in her eyes. But they knew also that they must get permission from Appiah and approval of the village council to help pay for treatment.

The rest of the day was like a bad dream, people of all colors and languages going hither and thither, nurses, white-clad and blue-clad, students, needles in the cheek, instruments taking samples, big machines that made pictures of the insides, waiting rooms, finally at the end of the long day she was given a charpoy in the women’s hostel to rest and a chit to return in a week if she wished to have the treatment.

They met up with Appiah, who had spent the day bartering and selling the paddy, and returned that night, exhausted but somehow hopeful, to the comfort of their village. Appiah agreed to the proposed treatment without question. Chinamma prepared a festive breakfast with uthappam, sambar and rasam, but reserving fresh curds for Yellamma. They all slept the entire day. Yellamma began to feel hopeful and prepared for a long day of planting, resolved not to submit to defeat. The only thing left was to get the approval of the elders and the blessings of the priest.

**3. Decision**
Govindaswami shook his head. “The mission doctors will only take our money and try to make her a Christian before she dies.” The village elders who were gathered around nodded. The oldest, Ramalingam, lean and frail, the village headman, listened quietly and then spoke firmly, “Appiah, the honor of the village and temple are at stake. How can she go to these mission people, surely bringing contamination back to our sacred land?”

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%', out.height="50%", fig.cap="Ramalingam and Govindaswami"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Carl_Ram_Govind.png")
```

Appiah felt a tremendous weight pressing him into the ground. What should he do? The priest too supported Govindaswami’s argument. Should Yellamma go through the traditional cure, the searing of the tumor, the application of salves, the blessing of the priest?  There was one person in the village that Appiah could turn to. Brahmasundaram, the son of Chittoor Doraiswami, the Brahmin who owned most of the village land, was visiting his family, on leave from medical studies in Madras. Surely, he could give an enlightened opinion.

The husband and her mother walked the kilometer separating the landowner’s home from the village. It was a pucca red-tiled two story building, built around a central courtyard, in a spacious compound surrounded by a brick wall and guarded by the chowkidar, an elderly man with a fierce military mustache. In a thatch covered carport sat a new white Ambassador automobile. They asked to see the son for a medical question. 

After a short time Brahmasundaram appeared, flanked by his father who was clothed in a spotless freshly starched dhoti, bare-chested with the sacred thread crossing the torso after the Brahmin tradition, and three vertical lines representing the trident of Shiva marked in ash on his forehead.  His son, bespectacled, tall and lean, who appeared to have come from the tennis court on the compound, wore white trousers, shirt, and shoes. 

“How can I help you?” Brahmasundaram asked in the local vernacular.  Appiah recounted Yellamma’s situation with frequent interjections from Chinamma. “Doctor Aiya,” Appiah concluded respectfully, “We have a serious problem. The priest wants Yellamma to have treatment by Govindaswami. He says that it would drive out the evil spirit that brought all this trouble but the hospital doctors say that they can cure her.  What should we do?” 

The elder man looked at his son and in high Tamil said, “Allow the village elders to decide. This woman deserves the wisdom of the village.” 
The young man hesitated. His father always supported and nurtured the local traditions and hierarchy that had given stability to the village community for generations. The local priest was a Brahmin too, although of the Ayengar subcaste. But Brahmasundaram knew also stories of the results of treatment by village healers and had knowledge as well of the “Western” treatment of these cancers from his modern medical training in Madras. 

The village traditions and his father must be respected, but he knew from local hearsay that the holy man residing in the nearby hills, Sri Krishnapillai, was a retired teacher from Tirunelvelli, a highly educated man, enlightened in modern ways. The son consulted with his father, who nodded approval, and then turned to the two villagers. “Appiah, tell your wife to go for counsel from the holy man at the spring in the hill above us and then come back to see me tomorrow.” 

The next morning, Chinamma led Yellamma and Appiah up the hill to the shrine. Chinamma had been there many times to meditate and seek advice from the sage. They followed the stream up a well trodden path and entered a small glade, lush with grass and flanked by numerous trees. At the head of the meadow was a small shrine, built of sandstone, consisting of four pillars supporting a conical overhanging cupola with finely detailed carvings of scenes from Krishna’s life. The walls of the granite platform supporting the structure had a frieze of gopis and musicians in ecstatic movements and embraces. It was a temple obviously built century before. In the center of the platform, open in all directions, sat an elderly man, white-bearded, wearing only dhoti and glasses. Around him was a group of six children, dressed in the uniform of the regional primary school along with a teacher, wearing a silk sari, all dressed up in their Sunday best, for, indeed, it was that holiday. Sri Krishnapillai greeted the newcomers with a smile and a wave, bidding them to find a place to sit. He continued with his discourse to the school group about the lives of the great saints of India, in fact a sort of Sunday school for the youngsters. In a while the lesson was finished, and the group left with animated chatter and expressions of gratitude.

He turned to the newcomers, and asked, “What can I do for you?” Appiah responded and then Chinamma took over and recounted the story that had been so often repeated. The sage listened intently, frequently interjecting questions on the details of the doctor’s findings and proposals and the priest’s counterargument. Finally, he turned to Yellamma, who had sat silent through the long interview’ “Amma, you know that you have a serious condition, it will cause much pain and suffering before death if it is not properly treated. You must choose quickly.”

Yellamma bowed her head and asked, “Nandri, Vellaram Aiya (Thank you, respected divine Sir), I will follow your counsel. But what is your advice?”

Sri Krishnapillai gave her a look of gentle impatience, “Amma, there is only one thing to do. Get the permission of the elders. My note will be sufficient. Then return to the hospital and follow the instructions exactly as the doctors direct. But go to the temple near the hospital every puja day that you are there and have the priest sprinkle water of the Ganges over the place that the doctors are treating. Then repeat the mantras I will give you twelve times a day. Your experiences at the hospital through this crisis can be of help to your family and village. And also, please convey my greetings to Reverend Jesudas, their chaplain, my old friend and classmate at the university.”

The elderly man then recited the simple mantras until Yellamma could repeat them, wrote a chit to give the village elders, and then dismissed the trio with a casual wave of the hand. He then took up the book that he was reading. It was “The Nature of the Universe” by the physicist, Sir Arthur Eddington.
Appiah led the group back down the hill and across the paddy fields to their village.

The second meeting with Brahmasundaram went quickly. He was pleased; the village elders would be satisfied and the poor woman would get the best treatment and also spiritual support from her faith. His father accepted the son’s recommendation and called in the village elders to deliver the note from Sri Krishnapillai and explain it to gain their approval for hospital charges.

Next morning the air was cold and smoke from the cooking fires lay over the valley in sheets of purple and blue. Appiah and his brother carried the baggage as the two women followed them to the bus stop two kilometers from the village. 

**4. Return**
Yellamma’s homecoming from the hospital came on the eve of Pongal. The entire village was in a happy turmoil of cleaning the houses and outbuildings, breaking and discarding old pots and utensils, reflooring the homes and grounds with fresh cow dung and clay slurry, and painting the cattle horns, carts and tools in festive colors.

``` 

Yellamma was joyful to finally be back in her own home and village. She had recovered her taste, appetite and weight after the mysterious treatment that the mission doctors had called “radium.” She recounted her experiences repeatedly to fascinated audiences of men, women, and children: the mystery of the operating theater with the masked and robed doctors and nurses surrounding her as if in some sort of ancient ritual; of waking up in her hospital bed with  strange devices in her face and neck that remained several days; the pain and discomfort through that time, of taking only liquid nourishment, finally the removal of the magic needles but the continued pain relieved by injections of medicines that gave a wonderful feeling of pleasure; finally, after weeks, the return of comfort, taste, and the ability to eat normally.

The festivities soon became the whole life of the village. Drums beat day and night.
There came itinerant musicians and dancers, tribal people from the nearby hills who improvised theater sets and in the light of hissing Petromax lanterns performed scenes from the Ramayana, the performances often lasting until dawn. The Brahmin zamindar and his family, sponsors of the imported artists, sat and observed discretely in a panoplied pandal.  

Yellamma and her family rejoined the flow of village life. The priest blessed her with the mark of Vishnu upon her forehead when she went to perform the puja of thanks at the temple. She walked up the hill along with Chinamma to the little shrine where Sri Krishnapillai, surrounded by the usual attentive audience of worshippers and of the curious, bade that a way be made for them. He interrogated Yellamma at length and heard her recount what she had experienced.

During recuperation in the hospital (Yellamma recounted to the sage) she had met young women in uniforms different from the nurses. They asked about her family, home life, and village. Yellamma liked one particularly. Radha was a tall, fair young woman from Kancheepuram who had come nearly every day to listen to her problems. She told Radha about the loss of her second newborn son from “the black disease.” She related how the village midwife had helped to deliver the child, cutting the umbilical cord with a knife and tying it off with sinew. Within a week the umbilical stump began to fester, turning black as the newborn infant developed high fever, and then convulsions, and was soon dead. Yellamma told of other horror stories, of other newborns and infants dying of intractable diarrhea, of small pox and of measles.

Radha had listened intently and wrote everything down in her notebook. She talked to Yellamma about sanitation and making water safe to drink, of ways to avoid mosquitoes, and the dangers of walking barefoot in the fields where the villagers went for their daily bodily functions.

 “Radha’” she asked one day, “Why not come to our village to help us to understand the things that you ask me, about matters of health and proper nutrition, things that we know little about?” 
Radha nodded her head enthusiastically, “Oh, Amma, that is a wonderful idea. Let me talk to my boss about the possibility.” 

The next day Radha returned with her department head. A trim, short, animated man in white bush shirt, trousers and sandals, he questioned Yellamma and then asked, “Amma, will your village want our help?” Yellamma wagged her head vigorously in the South Indian gesture of agreement. “Yes, Doctor Aiya, if the men agree. I will do all I can to get it. I know that the women will all agree. We need help from someone who knows our problems. The government health center is too far away, they never come to see us, and the people there are fat and lazy with their government salaries.”

“Very well,” the doctor replied, “If you can get the permission and invitation from your panchayat, we will seek the necessary approval from the District Medical Officer and the Tahsildar to set up a visiting clinic. It will not be easy because there are prejudices against us even though most of the doctors and nurses are non-Christian. It may take time, but here in India, time is known to be eternal and need not worry anyone, because it is always there.”  The doctor, who was called Professor Mathai, head of Community Medicine, smiled at his small joke.

With Radha’s help, Yellamma practiced reading and writing Tamil, improving on the remnants of her brief schooling in the taluk. She began to read pamphlets that Radha had given her about health and nutrition. A new idea burned in her mind as the words of the sage echoed, “Your experience can help your family and village.”

She finished by telling Sri Krishnapillai that she had been blessed with good fortune, and if her health continued that she could help carry back to the village some of the modern ideas of health that she had learned at the hospital.

Sri Krishnapillai listened to Yellamma’s long discourse and then said, “Amma, you can bring the blessings of your healing to your fellow villagers. The people at the mission hospital mean well and they have much to offer. Inform the panchayat of their goodwill and ask them to invite Radha to visit the women of the village. I am sure they will agree after seeing what has happened to you.”
Yellamma gratefully left the offering of fresh fruits and coconuts, leaving the shrine with a shining smile.

**5. Trouble**
Govindaswami again shook his head, “What ideas are these, Yellamma? You want the foreigners to come to this village and change the way we do things?” Ramalingam nodded in agreement. Yellamma answered calmly, “You misunderstand. They are fellow Tamils, who do not even think of changing your ways or anyone else’s. They want to help us with issues of health. The women want this and have asked me to speak for them. We are now an organization, the Elagiri Women’s Association. Don’t you understand why we want it?”

The assembled men shook their heads.
“Look at the children who are weak and not growing well with their blood like water. Think of the infants who have died this year of the “black disease”. Look at your own nephew, Govindaswami, with scabies,” she spoke with heated emphasis.

Govindaswami gave her a startled look. He turned to Ramalingam and asked, “Should we let these women run our village?” Ramalingam turned to the others on the verandah of the village clerk’s hut. No one answered. Some shrugged their shoulders and others busied themselves with lighting cheroots or bidis.
“Perhaps we can let them come for a look,” answered Ramalingam. The others nodded. 

**6. One Year Later**
It was a holiday, a three day festival called Adi Kappu celebrating the goddesses of each caste, the Grama Devathais. Music, dances, dramas with actors and bands of musicians were celebrated with the neighboring villages. A special event had been organized by the Panchayat for the second afternoon.
Yellamma was nervous and anxious that afternoon, arranging and rearranging her sari, putting on her make-up of turmeric and kohl and dressing the children in their newly bought clothes. Appiah proudly wore a new lungi made of fine cotton by the weavers of Malevelli and a long sleeved shirt of rayon made in Japan.

Soon the dignitaries arrived: Sri Krishnapillai was mounted on the temple elephant with the mahout, flanked by two priests, with many of his followers, mostly young women in bright saris, beating tambourines and strewing flowers along the elephant’s path to Elagiri; then the Tahsildar of the district along with Dr. Subramaniam, the Chief Medical Officer, in traditional dress, in a government Matador Jeep; finally a delegation from the mission hospital, Professor Mathai, Radha and several of her co-workers, the blond haired doctor who had performed the operation on Yellamma, and an American, Professor Hamilton, a young parasitologist, in the hospital Land Rover.

Electricians from the town had come to set up a generator, wiring and a loud-speaker system for the ceremony.  The band beat drums incessantly and blew on shernais as the dignitaries, village officials, and the crowd of spectators gathered. Finally, things settled, the dignitaries seated in chairs on the dais in front of the microphone, the village officials seated to the side, while the Brahmin landowner with his family sat a slight distance behind. Dominating the scene was a new building, a pucca construction of brick and mortar with a tile roof, festooned with multicolored ribbons, with a sign, in Tamil and English, “Elagiri Panchayat Primary Health Center, established by the Women’s Association of Elagiri.”

Govindaswami, resplendent in white lungi and tunic, had been selected by the Panchayat to preside. He proudly introduced the guests of honor, one by one, as young women of the village came up to drape a garland of marigold and jasmine around the neck.

The dedication ceremony dragged on through the afternoon. One after another, starting with the Tahsildar, the speakers droned the usual platitudes, the audience, half-dozing, clapping at the right moments. Finally, came the turn of Sri Krishnapillai, now dressed in a flowing robe that streamed behind as he briskly strode to the microphone. The audience awoke, alert to hear something original
He turned toward Yellamma and folded his palms together saying, “To this woman we should all be grateful for the creation of this center of health care and education for this entire taluk.”  Heads turned toward her as she blushed under her dusky complexion, instinctively pulling the end of the sari across her face.

The holy man continued in his resonant, teacher’s voice, “She has mobilized the women to lead the charge against ignorance and apathy. And the men responded and brought their creative efforts together to construct this building, a symbol for progress and enlightenment. I wish to especially mention Govindaswami Appa who led the effort and whose skill has resulted in this beautiful and solid structure.”

Heads turned again as Govindaswami acknowledged the applause with a bowed head. 
“And last but not least”, he smiled at the platitude, “Doraiswami Aiya contributed funds to supply the building with modern equipment, including a gas sterilizer and refrigerator for medicines and vaccines. As you already have heard, Dr. Subramaniam will send a district nurse bimonthly and the mission hospital will send a nurse and registrar also bimonthly so that there will be a weekly surgery (clinic).”

“I commend this project and this building to the cosmic energy that the universe bestows even handidly on all positive good deeds and ask Pundit Ramaswamiayengar to bless this building and all that is within it.”
 
                                                PANDIT RAMASWAMIAYENGAR

As the priest came forward with a bowl of burning incense, the crowd of spectators erupted into applause and began to move closer to participate in the ceremony and partake of the prasadum.

In the turmoil Yellamma became the center of attention with her proud husband protecting her from the pressure of the crowd. She became quickly involved in talking to the nurses from the DMO’s office and from the hospital to organize a daily reading of health issues that Yellamma and other village women would deliver at the health center.

The doctors clustered together, discussing the coordination of efforts to treat and eliminate hookworm, malaria and dysentery in the area, and to begin a vaccination program against smallpox and measles. The Tahsildar talked to the panchayat about the new scheme of bringing electrical power to the village. The young American professor was introduced by Brahmasundaram to the village elders to discuss his project to collect and examine stool samples for parasites.

After a simple but sumptuous banquet of rice, rasam, curds, vegetable curry and fruit, served on banana leaves, that lasted into the evening, Sri Krishnapillai ended the function with a brief prayer in Sanskrit, translated to Tamil by the village priest, and, as he was leaving, surrounded by his acolytes, said to Yellamma, “The Lord has blessed you and you have blessed the village with your goodness. Come to see me whenever you wish.” 

Yellamma turned to Chinamma and sighed, “What a nice old man!”
