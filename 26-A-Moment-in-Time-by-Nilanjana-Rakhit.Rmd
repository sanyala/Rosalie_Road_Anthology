# A Moment in Time by Nilanjana Rakhit {-}


It’s America’s election night,

Everything in the air just feels right.

From noble concession, to the celebration 

Of one man’s win, and

The victory of the human spirit.

It’s about a dream coming true,

A historic moment in time,

A long struggle in pursuit of recognition,

Overcoming the hurdles, reaching

Closer to its destination.

It’s about humanity’s cry for

Equality, harmony and space.

It’s about the dream of a race, 

A nation reaching at last,

A historic new place.

It’s about a white mother in awe,

Saying on television what she saw,

How she woke up her children at dawn,

Telling them of the coming true,

Of Dr. King’s dream.

It’s about a nation’s journey,

From denial to the higher truth,

Lifting the flickering light,

Of human spirit,

To shine like the sun.
