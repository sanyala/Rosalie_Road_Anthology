# My School Days in Baghdad and Calcutta {-}


Home Schooling, Day Dreaming and a Preamble to Calcutta Boy's School

In 1964, my father took leave from Indian Airlines in Calcutta and joined Iraqi Airways in Baghdad. He was a flight engineer with the RAF during World War II and was subsequently one of the first batches of engineers to be trained on the Vickers Viscount, the new airliner of the 1960s. The opportunity with Iraq arose from that experience. Talent has always been from time immemorial, mobile. 

My sister and I joined a French school run by the French Dominican order in the old quarters of Baghdad, housed in a church and convent dating to the time of the Crusades. The school was housed alongside the church in a beautiful stone building with huge windows, tall graceful wooden doors and stone arches with lovely stone carvings on the abutments. There was also a small luxuriant rose garden which was a riot of colors in the winter and spring. We learnt Mathematics, History, Geography, French Literature and Science in the French language. I had no introduction to the French language or culture except for one solitary picnic to Chandanagore, a onetime French colony near Calcutta where we visited the churches. 

I and my sister struggled, but I was able to learn and converse in the language within a few months. My prized possession from that period is a tattered Tintin comic book, in French, “Le Trésor de Rackham le Rouge” (Red Rackham’s Treasure) by Belgian cartoonist Hergé which I received as a prize for recitation in French. I still have that book. I was eight years old.

Within the first few years we became reasonably fluent in French and Arabic. After two years, my parents moved us to a school run by a Mr. and Mrs. Hartley an expatriate British couple where the language of instruction was English. The school had children from the expatriate community in Baghdad and my friends were from all over the world. It was a great experience; the academic materials were easy, and I breezed through school spending most of my time playing various outdoor games that we would make up with my friends in the hot midday sun.

After a year at Mr Hartley’s school, my mother decided to take us back to Calcutta to see if we could live there and study while my father continued to work and stay in Baghdad. I re-joined Don Bosco School and my sister went back to Pratt Memorial School, both in Calcutta. This experiment lasted for a year.

Calcutta in 1965 was an incredibly hard place to live. There were endless shortages of bread, milk, butter, fish, eggs and other daily necessities. Cooking gas was not available then, so everything had to be cooked on Kerosene stoves or small portable ovens fueled by briquettes made from crushed coal and cow dung. These portable ovens were difficult to use, and the Kerosene was only available through your government issued ration cards. You would receive your weekly allotment of rice, wheat, sugar and Kerosene after standing in a line for a couple of hours. It was a realistic and brutal manifestation of Nehruvian socialist policies in its fullest glory. All the acquisition of these necessities including the buying of provisions was done by servants, but the process was enervating. India also went into a war with Pakistan in early August of that year of which I have some recollection. The war only compounded the shortage of food and made life even more difficult.
Something as simple as a regular supply of milk was hard to arrange and if available was likely diluted or of doubtful provenance. A local “khatal owner” offered to sell my mother a couple of cows to provide fresh milk and he would take care of their feeding and milking, but they would have to stay in our house. My mother wisely demurred and opted for “sweet shop milk”. 
She made arrangements with a leading sweetshop for our milk supply. Sweet shops were allowed to have specific access to their own cows or diaries. My mother knew the owner’s daughter and we were given special dispensation to access the milk. They would not deliver it since it was illegal to sell their milk and so every day after school, we would go to the shop and drink large glasses of frothy, steaming, sweetened milk served in large earthenware pots with the added bonus of snacking on Samosas, Kachuris and other delicacies. 

That year we went to Baghdad for the summer holidays and my father also came and visited us. I could however see that the stress of living in Calcutta was taking its toll on my mother and after a year of living in Calcutta, my parents decided that we were to be home-schooled and we wound up the Calcutta house and moved back to Baghdad. My mother met the Principal of Don Bosco School, Father Rosario and requested that I remain a student of the school for which she would be paying the full year’s fee in advance. In turn, the school would forward their books, examination papers etc., and my mother would teach me and proctor my exams. Subsequent to my taking the examinations she would mail them to the school for assessment and feedback. It was an unorthodox arrangement and I guess we were the pioneers of long distance learning with the usual “air mail’ from Calcutta to Baghdad then taking about 2 – 3 weeks and sometimes never reaching its destination. 

My sister was packed off to a boarding school in Beirut where she stayed for four years and finished school completing her GCE ‘O’ and ‘A’ levels. She later went on to finish her Economics degree from Lady Brabourne College in Calcutta and her Ph.D. in Econometrics from Jadavpur University. She is now a Professor at the Madras School of Economics.

My parents had an extensive library of English and Bengali books which included a few books that my father hinted were not appropriate for me to read. He did not explicitly forbid me to read them but made the suggestion that I might find them difficult to understand. If I remember right, the books that I read and a few that were hard to comprehend were the following:

* Lady’s Chatterley’s Lover by D. H. Lawrence
* Two Women by Alberto Moravia
* Never Love a Stranger, The Carpet Baggers, A Stone for Danny Fisher, Where Love has Gone – All these books were by Harold Robbins
* Bonjour Tristesse by Francois Sagan
* The Continent of Circe by Nirad Chaudhuri
* An Area of Darkness by V. S. Naipaul
* Poems by Byron, Shelley, Wordsworth and Coleridge. Most of these were compiled in a small book called “The Golden Treasury”.
* My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell
* The Secret of Santa Vittoria
* All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque – A book on World War 1
* The Dam Busters
* The 20th July Plot
* Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler
* Lolita by Vladmir Nabokov

I also had an extensive collection of “my” Enid Blyton and Richmal Crompton books – “Five Five Outers”, “the Billy Bunter books by Frank Richards”, “the William … series” by  Richmal Crompton and the books on Biggles created by W. E. Johns. As an adult, I would continue to read and re-read most of Nabokov’s books. I read a few chapters of Mein Kampf and completed most of the other World War II books since I had a strong interest in that era with my father having served in the RAF during that period.

I continued to be home schooled and enjoying every minute. We tried to “maintain” normal school hours and my mother would determine the curriculum, homework and lesson plans. I would finish my daily school work as quickly as possible and spent the rest of the day outside creating imaginary cities and war scenarios in the wild jungles of my mind and our backyard, playing with my toy cars, boats and planes in the cities, deserts and oceans that I had created amongst the long eucalyptus trees and my father’s rose and vegetable flower beds. When I got bored or it became unbearably hot, I would come back inside and pretend to study, while actually reading “Two Women” or “Lady Chatterley’s Lover” or even “Where Love Has Gone”, “Biggles”, “Billy Bunter” which were tucked into the inner recesses of the comfortable large black and brown sofas of the vast mostly unused living room. 

I am not sure how the Harold Robbins books got into such august company, but I enjoyed the explicit descriptions with no real comprehension of what it entailed.  I had the faint realization that I was growing up to be somewhat weird, with hardly any friends, spending most my time playing imaginary war games or reading “Two Women” or “Billy Bunter”. My parents were also becoming apprehensive that my schooling was unconventional, but I think that we all pretended that the problem would resolve itself over time. Most of the children of my parent’s friends were dispatched off to boarding schools in India and England. I was attached to my mother and in spite of the hilarious descriptions and escapades of Bill Bunter, Frank Nugent, Bob Chery and Hurree Jamset Ram Singh and others that I would read in the Greyfairs school of Billy Bunter yore, the thought of boarding school filled me with foreboding and gloom. As I learnt much later in life, good times like an analogous bull stock market do not last.

Our extensive book and record collection also included the Rabindra Rachanabali, packed with care and imported from Calcutta, as well as an extensive collection of EP and LP Bengali records which kept my mother and her friends busy and engaged. My parents would host occasional Bengali plays in our house where the whole family would act in some role or the other. I remember that we acted in “Kabliwala” and “Khokababur Pratyabartan”, “Mayar Khela” along with other members of the Bengali community in Baghdad who would direct, act, sing or provide music. These cultural nights were usually followed by dinner served on tables groaning with Bengali food and deserts.

Iraq had been the cradle of civilization and there were numerous ruins and unexcavated archaeological treasures within a couple of hours of driving distance from our house. We went to the fabled “Hanging Gardens of Babylon”, then in ruins but full of archaeological artifacts lying unprotected and yours for the taking. I then decided that I want to become an archaeologist and started collecting cuneiform tablets, pieces of pottery and miscellaneous relics and objects during these visits of ours. Over the next few years my collection became so large that my parents moved them to a room on the second floor. I would read history and archaeological books borrowed from the British Council library and painstakingly label and catalog my archaeological collection based on my readings in an exercise book.  This is when I read about Gertrude Bell, a British woman who was responsible for the birth of the various Hashemite kingdoms of Iraq, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. I also read books by Leonard Woolley a British archaeologist, including one I remember called “Ur of the Chaldees”. He was responsible for the excavations at Ur which was supposed to be the real location of the Garden of Eden. 

Many years later being an Agatha Christie fan and as part of my everlasting effort of collecting mental trivia, I came to know that Agatha Christie had based her book “Murder in Mesopotamia” on her experiences during her visit to the excavations at Ur. The murder victim was based on Katherine Woolley, Leonard’s Woolley’s wife who was universally disliked. Agatha Christie also met her husband, archaeologist Max Mallowan, one of Leonard’s Woolley’s colleagues during her visit to Ur.
In 1968 my parents realized that the schooling problem would not resolve by itself and I needed a formal and structured education. My father wrote introductory letters with the help of some his friends to Doon School in Dehra Dun, Bishop Cotton School in Simla and a few other boarding schools. Doon and Bishop Cotton replied favorably and invited my parents and me for a visit to determine the possibility of transferring to either of those schools. A friend of my father in UK also suggested that we should apply to Manchester Grammar School and my father immediately sent off a letter and the school responded by giving me provisional admission.

In the spring of 1968, my future schooling still undetermined we went for our usual holiday to Calcutta. The subject of my education was on everybody’s mind and my uncle suggested that we should meet with the principal of Calcutta Boys’ School – a certain Clifford Hicks who might be able to help out. After some due diligence, my parents found out that getting admission into Calcutta Boy’s School was virtually impossible in the middle of the year and also directly into Grade 8. The admissions process was based on an examination and an evaluation process held each summer that admitted students into only grade 1 for the subsequent year. Rarely were students admitted into higher grades. 
	
We met with Clifford Hicks, an imposing large man of distinct Anglo-Saxon origins, sitting behind an enormous circular wooden desk in an office surrounded by cavernous book shelves and framed sepia pictures of past principals, deacons and church officials. My parents told him about our predicament and Mr. Hicks asked me a few questions about my areas of interest. I told him about my interest in geography, archaeology and the history of Mesopotamia.  After an hour’s worth of discussion about the situation in Iraq and what my father did there and “sniffing around” a few relatives in Government of India circles in Calcutta and Delhi who Mr. Hicks knew, he told my mother who was doing most of the talking that “Your son can start boarding school tomorrow”. My heart thudded when I heard those words and I was crestfallen. We went back to our uncle’s place with tears welling up in my eyes at the thought of leaving home and my parents, my toys, my books and my archaeological collection.  My parents were as pleased as Punch at achieving such an unexpected and quick solution to their problem. I was 13 years old. 

I learnt a lesson. Everybody including your parents will take the easiest solution available to them.
