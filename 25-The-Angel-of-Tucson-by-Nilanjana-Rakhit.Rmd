# The Angel of Tucson by Nilanjana Rakhit {-}


She was born in terror,

defying all odds.

She died in terror,

in the hands of terror lords.

Life in death, death in life,

Nine eleven, January ten,

Two sides of the same coin,

the  dualities of Life, still Life goes on.

Terror, terror everywhere,

Peace, peace, seems nowhere.

Is there something terribly wrong?

Or there is something to learn from.

Aren't you the humans,

Nature's best creatures?

Look at yourself,

for your mindless tortures.

Christine, the Angel of Tucson,

Let not your life be in vain.

When will there be peace,

On this earth again?
